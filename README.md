For any restaurant, you can checkout all the different type of dishes available with details and prices per quantity.
Add to cart

Place Order.

# Improvements to make

Cart data is not stored anywhere, it should be in local storage for not logged in users to avoid losing on refresh page.
While Signing up, user name is not displayed in the profile point instantly, needs a refresh. It doesn't happen in logging in process.
Improve the design, take user address and payment details.
Add feature to search different cities, currently working for Prayagraj only.
